LANLORD V4 — INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=======================================

PREREQUISITES
-------------
  • Windows 10 or later (x86 / x64)
  • Administrator privileges are required
  • .NET 8 Desktop Runtime (x86) must be installed
    Download: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0


STEP-BY-STEP
------------

1. Install Npcap (packet capture driver)
   - Run "npcap-1.87.exe" found in the application folder.
   - During installation, CHECK "Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode".
     (LanLord will not work without this option enabled.)
   - Finish the installer and reboot if prompted.

2. Run LanLord
   - Right-click "LanLord.exe" and select "Run as administrator".
     (Administrator rights are required to capture and inject network packets.)
   - On first launch, select your active network adapter from the adapter selection window and click OK.

3. That's it — make fair and responsible use of this tool and enjoy!


NOTES
-----
  • If you see "problem installing the drivers", Npcap is either not installed
    or was installed without WinPcap API-compatible Mode. Re-run npcap-1.87.exe
    and enable that option.
  • LanLord minimizes to the system tray when the window is minimized.
    Double-click the tray icon to restore it.
  • ARP spoofing features require the target devices to be on the same
    local network (subnet) as the machine running LanLord.
